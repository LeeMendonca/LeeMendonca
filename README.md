# About Me

Hi! My name is LetÃ­cia Ferreira MendonÃ§a, I am a student at the Municipal University of SÃ£o Caetano since August 2024. I am currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computer Science, but my journey into technology began long before that. I have loved technology since my first team project: developing a mobile application for adolescents in psychosocial vulnerability.

Unfortunately, I was unable to save the code used at the time, but here you can see my progress as a programmer in college and extracurricular courses, such as Python I, which I took at the Federal University of ABC.

I am currently looking for an internship in technology so that I can put my knowledge into practice in a corporate environment and start my career as a programmer.
