# About Me

Hi! My name is LetÃ­cia Ferreira MendonÃ§a, I am a student at the Municipal University of SÃ£o Caetano since August 2024. I am currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computer Science.

Here you can see my progress as a programmer in college and extracurricular courses.

On my GitHub, my **main projects are pinned** at the top for easy access. Simpler codes, exercises, and academic practices are organized into **portfolio repositories**, one for each language I study: C, HTML, Java, JavaScript, Python, and SQL.

I am currently looking for an internship in technology so that I can put my knowledge into practice in a corporate environment and start my career as a programmer.
